    "Machine learning can be divided into three major categories:\n",
    "- *Supervised learning* where we provide human guidance to the learning process.\n",
    "- *Unsupervised learning* where there is no human supervision.\n",
    "- *Reinforcement learning* is learning by trial and error, for example in robotics. Game playing programs, such as [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero), are often based on reinforcement learning."
