# Assignment 1 â€“ Feedback
## Task 1.1  
Looks good and works as expected.

## Task 1.2  
Looks good and works as expected.

## Task 1.3  
Looks good and works as expected. Also good job with the comments!

## Task 1.4  
Your function looks good, but there are a few inaccuracies. Carefully read the task description:\  
_Call the function with the argument cases_2000 and print the first 5 parties from the year 1999 from the result._\  
Also the task description suggests to use the `datetime` package to parse the dates. You dont have to do that, but it can be a bit nicer.  
Other than that the solution looks really good!

## Task 1.5  
Looks good and works as expected.
