The applicant had been duly notified of his rights and, in particular, of the right to request the appeal court to appoint a lawyer for him after signing the waiver. However, he failed to exercise that right. In those circumstances, the Court does not consider that the domestic court was under an obligation to appoint a lawyer for the applicant (see, for similar reasoning, Aleksandr Dementyev v. Russia, no. 43095/05, \u00a7 48-50, 28\u00a0November 2013, where the applicant was advised, inter alia, of his right to legal representation and did not at any point alert the authorities to any need for further legal advice or clarification, the Court held that the domestic authorities had not been obliged to intervene or take steps to ensure that the applicant was adequately represented). In that regard, the Court observes that nothing in the case file suggests that such a request would have been unduly burdensome for the applicant or required special steps to be taken by him (ibid., \u00a7 50).",

The former rules have to be analysed especially with the perspective of pluralism: if, as the European Court of Human Rights has said, \u201cthere can be no democracy without pluralism\u201d, the main point is to ascertain that additional requirements imposed on parties are not so heavy that may hurt the expression of social pluralism.

This is, for instance, the case in Germany (art. 21) or Ukraine (art. 40).

The possibility of adopting legal measures to foster respect for democratic principles in the selection of candidates is consistent with international standards and principles stated by the Venice Commission. However, legal intervention in the selection of candidates is not always required or suitable. On the one hand, long-established democracies with deep-rooted political parties favour associational freedom, since internal democracy is guaranteed by the political parties themselves. On the other hand, state interference in the selection of candidates in new or transitional democracies might jeopardise political pluralism. There is an increased risk where legal intervention constitutes an imposition of the majority over the minority.\u201d",

The judgment was based on two main propositions. First, the Karelia Supreme Court concluded that the procedure for the selection of candidates for the regional party\u2019s assembly had violated the ground rules of democratic representation and majority rule, and second, that the party had submitted invalid version of its charter. Concerning the first conclusion, the Karelia Supreme Court could not rely directly on any provision of domestic legislation since the domestic legislation did not govern internal party procedures to such an extent. Rather, it interpreted the provisions of the Political Parties Act and the Basic Guarantees Act as seen in their entirety. It applied the general principles of electoral legislation, such as the characteristics of a democratic regime, the will of the majority and the general principles of elections, to an internal party procedure. That procedure had conferred the right to participate in the selection of the party\u2019s governing bodies only to those members who had chosen to register with the local bodies (see paragraph 24 above). Even though the court acknowledged that the practice had been based on the party\u2019s charter, which had provided for similar rules in both the 2004 and 2006 versions, it failed to respond to the party\u2019s argument that that fact could not be considered a new fact since the procedure had been known to the Electoral Commission on 17 and 22 August 2006, when it had ruled to register the lists.

The Commission acknowledges a certain dichotomy between the principles of party autonomy and that of internal democracy within the parties (see paragraph 5 of the Report on the Method of Nomination of Candidates within Political Parties, cited above in paragraph 44). The Guidelines on Political Party Regulation set the limit for State interference with the internal party activities as \u201cthe requirements for parties to be transparent concerning their decision-making and to seek input from membership when determining party constitutions and candidates\u201d (see paragraph 98 of the Guidelines on Political Party Regulation, cited above in paragraph 42). In its other documents, the Venice Commission recognises the difficulties of regulating questions of internal party democracy too closely (see, for example, paragraph 6 of the Report on the Method of Nomination of Candidates within Political Parties, paragraph 44 above). Nevertheless, it is apparent from those documents that the Venice Commission recognises that both \u201cdirect and indirect decision-making\u201d are permissible for members of political parties in issues of internal organisation and the nomination of candidates for elections, so long as the parties guarantee some form of representation for grass-roots party members, responsibility and accountability towards them and transparency in those procedures (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 35 of the Code of Good Practice in the Field of Political Parties, cited above in paragraph 40). The same Code in paragraph\u00a024 speaks of a \u201cnot uncommon\u201d practice to establish \u201cdifferent forms of involvement of individuals in [parties\u2019] activities such as members, recognised sympathisers, collaborators, campaigners etc.,\u201d and accepts it, as long as the party charter clearly spells out the rights and duties of each situation (ibid.).",

The procedure was sufficiently transparent to ensure that every party member could determine the scope of his or her participation in its work by choosing whether or not to register with the local offices. The party charter was applicable at the time of the selection procedure; the applicant party has been registered with the Karelia Registration Service since 2002 and both versions of the charter had been deposited with and accepted by the Federal Registration Authority (see paragraphs 7, 9, 11, 13 and 21 above). Lastly, no complaints have been made by members of the party, and the authorities acted upon their own initiative (compare with Republican Party of Russia, cited above, \u00a7 88). As a consequence, taking into account the similar regulations in both versions of the charter of the rules of candidates\u2019 nomination, as well as the fact that the new version had been known to the authorities before the submission of the relevant documents to the Electoral Commission, the decision to annul the Party list of candidates and the individual candidacies for a formalistic reason appears clearly disproportionate.",

She stressed that the other parties running for elections had either supported President Vladimir Putin or were hard-line communists and nationalists. The removal from the race of Yabloko \u2013 one of the strongest regional parties \u2013 one month before the elections had made it impossible to have any viable democratic alternative to take its place. The situation had been aggravated by the set-up of the election system which: (i) did not allow voters to add a party or a candidate to the list; (ii) did not permit a vote against all candidates; and (iii) had no requirement for a minimum turnout, so abstention of even a large part of the electorate would have had no impact on the election results. By way of comparison, the applicant pointed to a low turnout in the 2006 elections to the LA and noted that in 2011, when Yabloko had been allowed to run, it had increased significantly (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).",

The Government observed that the legislation and the Constitutional Court\u2019s practice established that members of the legislature were representatives of the people, and that therefore people who had not voted or had voted for another candidate could not be seen as having been deprived of representation in elected bodies.

An intention to vote for a specific party is essentially a thought confined to the forum internum of an individual. Its existence cannot be proved or disproved until and unless it has manifested itself through the act of voting or handing in a blank or spoiled paper (see X v. Austria, Commission decision of 22 March 1972, Yearbook 15, p. 474). Moreover, a voter\u2019s preference is not static but may evolve in time, influenced by political events and electoral campaigning.

The rule is based on the assumption that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no.\u00a024). At the same time, it is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v.

It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature (see Toshev v.

However, the words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2002-IV).

The Court observes that this argument contradicts the interpretation of the relevant national legislation given by the Russian Constitutional Court, which has emphasised on several occasions that the national courts are under an obligation to set a time-limit when ordering an individual\u2019s placement in, or extending the period of, pre-trial detention at any stage of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 30 above).

The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure clearly provides that an initial period of pre-trial detention may not exceed two months. It also takes into account the fact that the applicant did not claim that he had not been aware of that provision. The Court, however, is not persuaded that the maximum time-limit provided for in Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure should be applied implicitly each time an individual\u2019s placement in custody is authorised by a domestic court. It is true that this period, in itself, does not appear unreasonably long and can be justified by the need for the authorities to ensure the proper conduct of various investigative actions. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the  ruled that the period of one\u2019s detention should be clearly defined by a domestic court, this being an essential guarantee against arbitrariness. With this in mind, the Court considers that the absence of any specific time-limit in the District Court\u2019s decision of 4\u00a0February 2011 amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d capable of rendering the applicant\u2019s detention pursuant to that order arbitrary and therefore \u201cunlawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1.

He sent his statement of appeal to the appeal court while he was required by law to send it to the court of first instance for processing purposes. The appeal court had to resend the document to the court of first instance, which, undoubtedly, caused a delay in the scheduling and preparing of the appeal hearing. Nevertheless, despite that omission on the applicant\u2019s part, the Court is not convinced that the review of the applicant\u2019s detention was speedy.

They all had to share the two bunks. When the applicant had been in a single occupancy cell, which she had initially estimated to measure about 3 to 3.5 sq. m, she had had to share with another detainee and a mattress of about 1.90 m would be placed on the dirty floor alongside her bed. This left only about 30 cm of free space between the mattress and the bed. The mattresses placed in the cells to accommodate additional detainees were filthy and sleeping on the concrete floor with only one blanket was very uncomfortable.

The Court has already ruled that police stations and other similar establishments which, by their very nature, are places designed to accommodate people for very short durations, are not appropriate places for the detention of people who are waiting for the application of an administrative measure, such as deportation (see, for example, Thuo v. Cyprus, no. 3869/07, \u00a7 159, 4 April 2017 with further references). On that point, the Court observes that the Cypriot authorities\u2019 practice of detaining aliens subject to deportation procedures in police facilities for long periods has been explicitly mentioned by the CPT, inter alia in its 2012 report describing such establishments as unsuitable for detaining people under immigration legislation for prolonged periods (see paragraph 22 above). It is true that the CPT\u2019s visit in 2008 took place nearly three years and ten months before the applicant\u2019s detention in the present case. However, there is nothing to suggest that the material conditions at the station changed dramatically between 2008 and 2012. This is evident from the description of the facilities set out in the Ombudsman\u2019s report of 31\u00a0July 2012 following her visit on 23 May 2012 during the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 23-29 above). The Ombudsman pointed out, inter alia, that the facilities were old and totally unsuitable for long-term detention and did not provide dignified conditions of detention (see paragraph 25 above).",

Thus, having in mind the above-mentioned inadequacy of the police station for accommodating the applicant for a long period of time, the Court will examine her complaint of overcrowding on the basis of the principles set out in the Mur\u0161i\u0107 case.",

The table they prepared concerning the number of detainees in the women\u2019s wing during the relevant period is also incomplete. It does appear from this table, however, that the women\u2019s wing was overcrowded for the majority of the days recorded and, overall, for more than two months during the applicant\u2019s detention. During the period of nearly five months, there are only fifteen days recorded where there were eight to ten detainees and only three when there were eleven detainees in the wing. The Government admitted that when the number of detainees exceeded the wing\u2019s capacity it was likely that the applicant would have shared a cell with another detainee, and therefore would have had 2.97 sq. m of personal space (see paragraphs\u00a014 and 42 above).",

These factors, in turn, require consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source (ibid.), whether the newspaper conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, \u00a7 37), whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner (Bergens Tidende and Others v. Norway, no. 26132/95, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2000IV) and whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (ibid., \u00a7 58). Hence, the nature of such an exemption from the ordinary requirement of verification of defamatory statements of fact is such that, in order to apply it in a manner consistent with the caselaw of this Court, the domestic courts have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case under consideration. If the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, they could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings, not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 19 April 2011, and Yordanova and Toshev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a05126/05, \u00a7\u00a048, 2 October 2012).",

The Court finds this conclusion rather strained. Firstly, the reference to the supposed \u201csmall wholesale business\u201d was of too general a nature to infer from it that Mr Fedorov held a paid post elsewhere. Secondly, it appears from the context of the article that such an inference was not the applicant\u2019s intention and was one that was unlikely to have been made by an average reader.",
