      "\n",
      "2. **Scalability**: Bitcoin's network can only process a limited number of transactions per second (around 7), which can lead to slower transaction times and higher fees during periods of heavy usage. This is often referred to as the \"block size debate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Energy Consumption**: Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism requires a large amount of energy to secure the network. This has led to concerns about its environmental impact. Some estimates suggest that Bitcoin's energy consumption is comparable to that of entire countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulation**: Bitcoin's decentralized nature makes it difficult for governments to regulate. While this is often seen as a strength, it also means that there's no central authority to protect users if something goes wrong. This has led to concerns about consumer protection and money laundering.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Security**: While Bitcoin's blockchain is secure, individual users' bitcoins can be stolen or lost if they don't properly secure their private keys. There have also been instances of exchanges being hacked, leading to significant losses for users.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Adoption**: For Bitcoin to become a widely used currency, it needs to be adopted by a large number of people\n"

      "Yale Information Society Project 8 8 problems. Thefts, bugs, and other problems can be undone if detected in time. Cryptocurrencies lack this critical feature. This is why cryptocurrency thefts, as a fraction of the available currency, are orders of magnitude more common and severe than thefts in the normal financial system.  The largest significant electronic bank heist, targeting the Bank of Bangladesh, managed to steal roughly $100 million.8 Cryptocurrency hacks of similar magnitude are almost a monthly occurrence; indeed, in the largest cryptocurrency hack on record, of Axie Infinity’s “Ronin Bridge,” hackers stole over $600 million.9 This ease of theft is inherent in the very nature of cryptocurrency. Stealing $10 million in physical cash requires that someone break into a secure location and move 100 kilograms of physical paper. Stealing $10 million in a traditional bank transfer requires both breaking into the bank’s computer and also quickly moving the money through a series of accounts to hide its origin, such that the victim’s bank cannot undo the theft. Stealing $10 million in cryptocurrency controlled by a computer, on the other hand, requires compromising the computer but—critically—the victim can’t recover the money.10 This creates significant friction in buying cryptocurrencies. Someone who wishes to sell cryptocurrencies cannot accept a conventional electronic payment. Instead they either have to have an established relationship with the buyer (to know the buyer poses an acceptable credit risk), accept cash, or accept an electronic payment and then wait for a few days.11 This drives up the price of buying cryptocurrency as all three options (validating credit risk, accepting cache, or waiting) incur additional expenses not present in other payment systems. Furthermore, the actual cryptocurrency transactions themselves can be surprisingly expensive.12 In order to act as a limit on spam transactions, where someone creates a huge number of useless transitions that need to be validated, slowing down the transaction verification process, any given cryptocurrency allows only a limited number of transactions per block in the blockchain. When the desired number of transactions is below this threshold, transactions are nearly free. But if the desired transaction rate exceeds this threshold, then prices can spiral as a fee auction is used to select which transactions to process due to the inelastic supply of available slots.\n"

      "The Death of Cryptocurrency | Nicholas Weaver 9 Bitcoin is particularly limited in this respect. Due to an early decision to limit spam by restricting the block size to just one megabyte, the Bitcoin network can only process somewhere between three and seven transactions per second worldwide. In comparison, the typical load on the VISA network is 1,700 transactions per second, and VISA has tested the system up to 64,000 transactions per second. During times of congestion, this can lead to the price for Bitcoin transactions reaching $50 or more. Other cryptocurrencies may have higher limits, which naturally leads them to be more vulnerable to spam. High congestion fees ensure that Bitcoin transactions can never be used for everyday, low-value payments. It is inconceivable that consumers would be willing to pay an extra $50 at the grocery store because they went shopping on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Cryptocurrency advocates will insist that “layer-two solutions” exist for this problem. They will often point to the Bitcoin “Lightning Network,” a protocol implemented on top of the underlying cryptocurrency, as an example of a solution. Unfortunately these don’t solve the fundamental problem of limited transaction capacity. Lightning works by creating a pre-funded payment channel between the user and a central relayer.13 From there the user can issue or receive payments that pass through a chain of relayers to the recipient. Eventually, a user may close the channel and receive the Bitcoin back onto the main blockchain. Thus, the internal payments no longer need to be recorded on the central blockchain. In creating, adding funds, and closing the channel, the user still needs to conduct a normal Bitcoin transaction. The Lightning network’s ability to create or close channels is limited by Bitcoin’s own transaction limitations. Therefore, Lightning cannot provide scaling as there is still a substantial limit on the number of channels that can be created, funded, or closed per second. The one example where Bitcoin did scale to a significant number of transactions was in El Salvador, though it scaled, ironically, by not actually using Bitcoin to process payments.14 The dictator of El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele, passed a law mandating that Bitcoin, along with the US dollar, would now be considered official currencies and merchants were\n",
