    "One of the important principles of programming is: *Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)*.\n",
    "This means that we should avoid repeating the same code with only small modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that loops are one way to make the computer do the work, instead of writing a lot of repetitive code.\n",
    "Another way to reuse code is making *functions*. Functions are pieces of code that perform a specific task.\n",

    "A function contains a (short) block of code/program statements. These statements are executed when we call the function. This way, we can perform a common operation many times without having to rewrite the code each time.\n",
